                            <p>Hi, I am Lac-Phong Nguyen. I am currently a junior in the class of 2021 at Dublin High School. In my experience so far in high school, I have developed a great interest in engineering, especially in software development. Throughout my high school career, I have taken three engineering classes in total (Computer Science Principles, Principles of Engineering, and AP Computer Science A). From these courses I have gained experience in not only computer languages like HTML, CSS, Python, Java, SQL, but also team leading, project management, and team collaboration. All of these classes required me to bond and connect with my fellow peers to create solutions to problems presented to us. Taking these courses has greatened my interest in software development even more and I have come to love the process of creating and seeing your own creation come to life. When I’m not I also play basketball, volleyball, piano, and videogames in my freetime. I’m also greatly invested in several manga, such as One Piece, Demon Slayer, Solo Leveling, Promised Neverland, Haikyuu, etc. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me for work, advice, or really anything.</p>
