                            <p>I'm Lac-Phong Nguyen, a Dublin High senior in the class of 2021. 
                                The dream job I see myself enjoying a lot is being a computer scientist, which is why I am currently enrolled in DHS's Engineering Academy. 
                                I don't care where I work because as long as I am coding and am happy, that is all that matters to me. 
                                My passion for coding is derived from my general interest in problem solving and puzzles. I love playing around with the logic of programming and creating wonderful and fun programs that do cool things. 
                                Other than coding, my other hobbies consist of piano and basketball. I picked up piano around 1st grade and have loved it ever since. 
                                The piano has been a way for me to express myself freely and relieve stress. Basketball on the other hand has been a fairly recent hobby of mine. 
                                Though I started back in 5th grade, I didn't take it seriously until around freshman year.</p>
                            <p>Without these hobbies, I am your everyday casual student. I come from a pure Vietnamese family of five and follow the many customs that come from being born into an Asian family, 
                                such as taking off shoes before entering someone's house, eating with my family in a huge shared dinner, studying, more studying, then after that studying!</p>
                            <p><strong>Some fun facts about me:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li id="big">My favorite food is pho.</li>
                                <li id="big">My favorite genre of music is classical music and piano works. I also enjoy EDM from time to time.</li>
                                <li id="big">Love Nintendo</li>
                            </ul>
=======
                            <p>Hi, I am Lac-Phong Nguyen. I am currently a junior in the class of 2021 at Dublin High School. In my experience so far in high school, I have developed a great interest in engineering, especially in software development. Throughout my high school career, I have taken three engineering classes in total (Computer Science Principles, Principles of Engineering, and AP Computer Science A). From these courses I have gained experience in not only computer languages like HTML, CSS, Python, Java, SQL, but also team leading, project management, and team collaboration. All of these classes required me to bond and connect with my fellow peers to create solutions to problems presented to us. Taking these courses has greatened my interest in software development even more and I have come to love the process of creating and seeing your own creation come to life. When I’m not I also play basketball, volleyball, piano, and videogames in my freetime. I’m also greatly invested in several manga, such as One Piece, Demon Slayer, Solo Leveling, Promised Neverland, Haikyuu, etc. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me for work, advice, or really anything.</p>
