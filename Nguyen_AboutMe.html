                            <p>I'm Lac-Phong, a Dublin High student. I am in the class of 2021 and am currently a freshman. The dream job I see myself enjoying a lot is being a computer scientist, which is why I plan to enroll in DHS's Engineering Academy. I really don't care where I work because as long as I am coding and am happy, that is all that really matters to me. Other than coding, my other hobbies consist of piano and basketball. I picked up piano around 1st grade and have loved it ever since. Piano has been a way for me to express myself freely and relieve stress. Basketball on the other hand has been a fairly recent hobby of mine. Though I started back in 5th grade, I didn't take it seriously until around this year as a freshman.</p>
                            <p>Without these hobbies, I am your everyday casual Asian. I come from a pure Vietnamese family of five and follow the many rules that come from being born into an Asian family, such as taking off shoes before entering someone's house, eating with my family in a huge shared dinner, and enjoying anime and manga. Typical Asian stuff.</p>
