                            <p>I'm Lac-Phong, a Dublin High student. I am in the class of 2021 and am currently a sophomore. The dream job I see myself enjoying a lot is being a computer scientist, which is why I am currently enrolled in DHS's Engineering Academy. I really don't care where I work because as long as I am coding and am happy, that is all that really matters to me. My passion for coding is not only strong because of the high wages that are given to computer programmers, but also because of my general curiosity and interest in solving problems and math. Other than coding, my other hobbies consist of piano and basketball. I picked up piano around 1st grade and have loved it ever since. Piano has been a way for me to express myself freely and relieve stress. Basketball on the other hand has been a fairly recent hobby of mine. Though I started back in 5th grade, I didn't take it seriously until around freshman year.</p>
                            <p>Without these hobbies, I am your everyday casual Asian. I come from a pure Vietnamese family of five and follow the many customs that come from being born into an Asian family, such as taking off shoes before entering someone's house, eating with my family in a huge shared dinner, studying, more studying, then after that studying! Typical Asian stuff.</p>
