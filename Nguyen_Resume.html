                    Dream colleges are UC Berkeley and Cal Poly since they are both fairly close schools and their engineering program is very good.

                    </p>

                    <p>Currently trilingual, being able to speak english, vietnamese, as well as spanish. Growing up speaking english, I am rather fluent at it. Vietnamese and spanish on the other hand are still a work in progress.
                    </br>Knowledge of programming languages on the other hand are fairly weak, knowing only bits of HTML as well as Python, but hope to gain a lot of experience in high school.

                    </br>One of my favorite hobbies is piano. I've been playing piano ever since 1st grade and can basically read and understand any note fluently, allowing me to play a variety of songs. During my time in the music school called Better World of Music, I've participated in more than 30 recitals.
                    </br>Another one of my favorite hobbies is basketball. In the 8th grade, I joined my first AAU team called the Cobras and won a weekly tournament in the season.
