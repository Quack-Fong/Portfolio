                            <p>This is my Scratch Project my partner and I worked on in our CSE class. We came up with this idea from brainstorming several game ideas and narrowed them down by our skillsets. The objective of our project was to make a fun <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/172696483/" alt="Revenge of Goofy Gumball" target="blank">game</a>. We documented this all in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MiyY36Wc6qZsf7YUrahh-eFrdHg3p6fFddGnNfHJnWI/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank" alt="Design Notebook">design notebook</a>. Since David, my partner, had experience with side-scrolling games on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" alt="Scratch" target="blank">Scratch</a>, we decided to do a side-scrolling adventure game. From there, we came up with this gumball thing and created a story where these red squares stole gumball's kids and gumball is trying to get them back. We were graded on this project through a rubric and instructions you can find <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YHIp8i0F-0V5eVyQZaS30F8D2QTFOKVVJSqlyG0o9J0/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank" alt="Project Rubric">here</a>. This project really helped me grow as a programmer and introduced me to the world of game development.</p>

                            <p>The Image Manipulation project is by far one of the hardest but most satisfying projects I have completed in CSE. The task was to utilize the py library and python to make a program that manipulates images in certain ways. This was the first project where Mr. Brown gave use free reign over our project, not giving any help unless it was necesscary. With my partner Justin Tsai, we immediately started to brainstorm on a <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pOJplUNdG3EdEshpQvcW4muWnQnMVmitIMHhXj3MZuE/edit?usp=sharing' target='blank' alt='Design Notebook'>document</a> what was needed and how we were going to finish the project. We both came into this project completely dumbfounded and at first had no idea what to do. But soon enough we were both able to get a hold of ourselves and the deeper we dug through the instructions the clearer everything seemed. Since I was a lot more experienced at python than Justin, we decided that I would work on Python while he focused on the documentation. Our theme for the project was the Clinton family because... we wanted to. The idea was to make a program that made a protrait of the family with something similar to a frame with a watermark as well as a black and white filter. Though the programming part was definitely challenging, when I started to do more manipulations the code seemed to become less and less complex and a whole lot more understandable. This project showed me the complexity of very simple actions in programming, such as black and white filters and borders, and helped me imporve a whole lot in the logic department of programming.</p>

                            <p>The HyTrojan Horse is the name of our hydrogen and solar powered car project for POE. Throughout this project we documented our progress on this <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/11CRerML1ndcARaovfmmLO2N-ScwT5NAeKjZF_egYgig/edit?usp=sharing' target='blank' alt='Design Notebook'>document</a> and this <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1taPOv5RBuK9UmS6qTDHN3Fk9TF1NDnGkmBRIpQEdFyo/edit?usp=sharing' target='blank' alt='Gantt Chart'>chart</a>. The goal of this project was to construct a car utilizing VEX parts that was able to run using either a solar or hydrogen cell. For this project, I was in charge of the documentation and assisting the other group members in the construction of our car. This was one of the hardest projects yet in POE, at least to me, because of the variety of variables that constantly blocked us from achieving our goals. These variables consisted of broken solar panels, broken motors, not powerful enough suns, etc. This was also the first project where I had personally had to take down and rebuild an idea from scratch. Our original design "Tambibien" was supposed to utilize a 7 to 1 gear ratio, but because of our janky build and motor configuration, it ultimately failed. We had to fall back to a 1 to 1 gear ratio and a very, very simple build. This project not only taught me failure, but hope and the power of determination as well, as our group, despite having to restart, put even more effort into our final product, "Paindemine". In terms of maximum theorhetical speed, "Paindemine" was far from what was thought for "Tambibien". For "paindemine" we had completely abandoned the gear ratio and focused on a simple working car. But even then, "Paindemine" showed great promise, as it not only worked, but was also faster than a lot of the other competition. Working on this project, even with its tough situations and problems, was a blast and I had a great time communnicating and working with Darion, Keagan, and Khalil on this project.</p>

                        <p><strong>The West Point Bridge</strong></p>
                        <p>POE P7* March 7th 2019</p>
                        <div class=col-md-6>
                            <p>The West Point Bridge project revolved around the use of <a href="http://bridgedesigner.org/" target="blank" alt="Bridge Desginer">Bridge Designer</a>. This program allowed users to build bridges, using a variety of members, materials, etc. and simulate how well the bridge performs under real-life scenarios. The goal of this project was to design a working bridge on Bridge Designer that was less than or equal to the $300,000 budget and 12-24 meters above the water. The performance of the bridge was based on how much stress or tension individual members went through and how much the bridge bent in the simulation overall. My job in this project was to design my own 2 working bridges and compare them with Micheal's 2 designs. I also had to collaborate with Michael to work on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eWcn20LMM0TlbXAq3pfLZp3sZ74dDm5W3ExDVf3b_ZM/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank" alt="Decision Matrix">Descision Matrix</a>, Bridge modifications, as well as the overall <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SgbxJ7LeDjpD_wOnB0cJBVroiCc74e-sAjHqpKAEhUY/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank" alt="Documentation">documentation</a> of the project. For the documentation, I was responsible for the Design Brief, part of the research, and the Final Justification of the bridge. From this project, I learned the different steps it takes to make an efficient bridge and understand the loop holes in getting the most efficient bridge. For example, to make the bridges cheaper, using hollow tubes was the most effective way to maximize performance, however solid tubes were necessary in certain areas if the members were undergoing too much tension. Making the member's surface area bigger was important if the members were undergoing too much compression and the use of different materials was crucial in the dispersion of forces throughout the bridge. Overall, I not only took away a better understanding of bridges and the aspects of compression and tension, but also the wonders of collaboration and teamworking from the modifications and decision matrix I did with Michael.
