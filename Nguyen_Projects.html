                            <p>This is my Scratch Project my partner and I worked on in our CSE class. We came up with this idea from brainstorming several game ideas and narrowed them down by our skillsets. The objective of our project was to make a fun <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/172696483/" alt="Revenge of Goofy Gumball" target="blank">game</a>. We documented this all in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MiyY36Wc6qZsf7YUrahh-eFrdHg3p6fFddGnNfHJnWI/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank" alt="Design Notebook">design notebook</a>. Since David, my partner, had experience with side-scrolling games on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" alt="Scratch" target="blank">Scratch</a>, we decided to do a side-scrolling adventure game. From there, we came up with this gumball thing and created a story where these red squares stole gumball's kids and gumball is trying to get them back. We were graded on this project through a rubric and instructions you can find <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YHIp8i0F-0V5eVyQZaS30F8D2QTFOKVVJSqlyG0o9J0/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank" alt="Project Rubric">here</a>. This project really helped me grow as a programmer and introduced me to the world of game development.</p>

                            <p>The Image Manipulation project is by far one of the hardest but most satisfying projects I have completed in CSE. The task was to utilize the py library and python to make a program that manipulates images in certain ways. This was the first project where Mr. Brown gave use free reign over our project, not giving any help unless it was necesscary. With my partner Justin Tsai, we immediately started to brainstorm on a <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pOJplUNdG3EdEshpQvcW4muWnQnMVmitIMHhXj3MZuE/edit?usp=sharing' target='blank' alt='Design Notebook'>document</a> what was needed and how we were going to finish the project. We both came into this project completely dumbfounded and at first had no idea what to do. But soon enough we were both able to get a hold of ourselves and the deeper we dug through the instructions the clearer everything seemed. Since I was a lot more experienced at python than Justin, we decided that I would work on Python while he focused on the documentation. Our theme for the project was the Clinton family because... we wanted to. The idea was to make a program that made a protrait of the family with something similar to a frame with a watermark as well as a black and white filter. Though the programming part was definitely challenging, when I started to do more manipulations the code seemed to become less and less complex and a whole lot more understandable. This project showed me the complexity of very simple actions in programming, such as black and white filters and borders, and helped me imporve a whole lot in the logic department of programming.</p>

                            <p>The HyTrojan Horse is the name of our hydrogen and solar powered car project for POE. Throughout this project we documented our progress on this <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/11CRerML1ndcARaovfmmLO2N-ScwT5NAeKjZF_egYgig/edit?usp=sharing' target='blank' alt='Design Notebook'>document</a> and this <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1taPOv5RBuK9UmS6qTDHN3Fk9TF1NDnGkmBRIpQEdFyo/edit?usp=sharing' target='blank' alt='Gantt Chart'>chart</a>. For this project, I was in charge of the documentation and assisting the other group members in the construction of our car. This was one of the hardest projects yet in POE, at least to me, because of the variety of variables that constantly blocked us from achieving our goals. These variables consisted of broken solar panels, broken motors, not powerful enough suns, etc. This was also the first project where I had personally had to take down and rebuild an idea from scratch. Our original design "Tambibien" was supposed to utilize a 7 to 1 gear ratio, but because of our jankey build and motor configuration, it ultimately failed. We had to fall back to a 1 to 1 gear ratio and a very, very simple build. This project not only taught me failure, but hope and the power of determination as well, as our group, despite having to restart, put even more effort into our final product, "Paindemine". In terms of maximum theorhetical speed, "Paindemine" was far from what was thought for "Tambibien". For "paindemine" we had completely abandoned the gear ratio and focused on a simple working car. but even then, "Paindemine" showed great promise, as it not only worked, but was also faster than a lot of other competition. Working on this project, even with its tough situations and problems, was a blast and I had a great time communnicating and working with Darion, Keagan, and Khalil on this project.</p>
